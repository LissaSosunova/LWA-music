      "text": "Morphine was an American alternative rock group formed by Mark Sandman, Dana Colley, and Jerome Deupree in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1989. After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded in 1999 after frontman Sandman died of a heart attack. Founding members have reformed into the band Vapors of Morphine, maintaining much of the original style and sound. Morphine combined blues and jazz elements with more traditional rock arrangements, giving the band an unusual sound. Sandman sang distinctively in a \"deep, laid-back croon\", and his songwriting featured a prominent beat influence. The band themselves coined the label \"low rock\" to describe their music, which involved \"a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a \"power trio\" not built around the sound of an electric guitar. Instead, with sly intelligence, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album. The band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially. In the United States the band was embraced and promoted by the indie rock community, including public and college radio stations and MTV's 120 Minutes, which the band once guest-hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in Belgium, Portugal, France and Australia.",

          "name": "Kurt Donald Cobain",
          "description": "(February 20, 1967 - April 5, 1994) On his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitarâ€”he chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to copy Led Zeppelin's power ballad, \"Stairway to Heaven\". \"Louie Louie\", Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\", and The Cars' \"My Best Friend's Girl\" were cover versions learnt by Cobain before he began working on his own songs. During high school, Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met Novoselic, a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair would occasionally practice in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Cobain's earlier band, Fecal Matter. After months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana."
